Reddit can be a very useful tool for a solo entreprenuer to gain early adopters for their products, to gain valueable insights about their business strategy or to connect with different communities related to the product to name a few. 
As a novice solopreneur I wanted to leverage the power of reddit to gain users and start earning some MRR. 

I created my first post and posted it on reddit, low and behold it was **Rejected !**. 
After some research I came to know that a lot of subreddits have a karma requirement for posts to not be rejected. I decided to buy a reddit account with high karma since I didn't know how I can boost my karma in a small amount of time. I'm going to write down in this post about how you can do the same.

## The Portal
I used [redaccs.com](https://redaccs.com/) to buy an account. The portal is not high tech but it does the job. 

Users can see new accounts appear periodically in this section. Just scroll down a little on the home page to arrive at this section.

## The Telegram group
As you can see in the image above, click on the *"Follow us to keep updated when ..."* button to be added to their telegram group. The owners keep the users of the group updated about the new reddit accounts that are going to be added to the portal. It is a telegram group and it looks something like this.

The accounts are usually in high demand so make sure to keep an eye on the group and quickly buy the desired account when they're available.

## Prepay for faster checkout
As mentioned in the previous section the accounts are usually high in demand so they get out of stock pretty quickly. That is also the reason why it is so competitive to get an account when they are in stock.

As an option you can prepay/top up your account with money to gain a speed advantage. I did the same and so I was able to buy my reddit account in the first try. 

You can go [here](https://redaccs.com/add-fund-to-your-account/) to do this, the owners have also provided a step by step guide of the same.

## Account in the mail !
Once you have bought your account, redaccs will send you all the information on your **email**. Please make sure you go through all the instructions and links mentioned in the email.
